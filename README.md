# Smart Health Predictor

With the advent of technology and the widespread use of mobile phones and websites as
user-friendly devices, our team will develop an application that predicts the most common
lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, and liver disease chronic
diseases. With a few pieces of information such as symptoms and diagnostic reports, a disease
predictor allows you to make critical predictions about an ongoing but unknown condition. It
also aids in having a thorough understanding of the symptoms, causes, and other significant
elements for future reference. People find it difficult to get to hospitals or clinics to consult
physicians for routine checkups because of the pandemic and their regular hectic schedules. We
play a significant role in assisting people with home-based solutions in this area. Predictions and
data provided as output become more accountable and adaptable when they are worked with
recognized and competent doctors. With such a great amount of various material available on the
internet, it's understandable that people might be perplexed while deciding which piece of
information to employ. However, with our Machine Learning, this difficulty is easily solved.
Over the past decade, the utilization of the particular disease predictor tools has increased due to
a range of diseases and a decrease in doctor-patient relations, since everything is available on the
internet nowadays. Thus, in this kind of a system, we have a tendency to concentrate on
providing immediate and correct disease prediction to the users concerning the symptoms they
enter alongside the severity of disease expected. For prediction of diseases, the most accurate
machine learning algorithms will be used which will guarantee fast and correct predictions.

## Lessons Learned

The main aim of this code is to predict the disease in accordance with symptoms put
down by the patients with proper implementation of Machine Learning algorithm. In this paper
we have used four Machine Learning algorithms for prediction and achieved the mean accuracy
of more than 95% which shows remarkable rectification and higher accuracy than previous work
and also makes this system more reliable than the existing one for this job and hence provides
better satisfaction to the user in comparison with the other one. Naive Bayes provides a higher
accuracy of 98% followed by a decision tree which is 97.3%. Once the disease is predicted, we
could easily manage the medicine resources required for the treatment. This model would help in
lowering the cost required in dealing with the disease and would also improve the recovery
process
